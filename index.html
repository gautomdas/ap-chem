            This is a result of the organic compounds involved being
            particularly vulnerable to UV radiation from the sun. Short
            wavelength light (violet or blue) have more energy than long
            wavelength light (red or orange. The bright orange reflects the
            orange light, absorbing the more harmful blue and violet light. This
            high energy excites the outer molecules of the paint and causes
            chemical bonds - fading the orange color.

            Chromophores are an atom or group whose presence is responsible for
            the color of a compound. Sunlight attacks the chromophores and
            changes their structure. The pigment then appears to be fading.
            Chromate reductions result. Oxygen generates free radicals which
            metal ions join to further the chromate reduction.

            Use UV Protection in the form of paint sealants. A coating is not a
            full solution as it will eventually fade away. In addition to using
            a paint sealant to prevent the paint from oxidizing, make sure to
            keep the plane out of sun whenever possible. Also, use a physical
            cover to protect the plane from UV rays or keep in the shade as
            often as possible. Lastly, it is also good to wash the plan often to
            prevent oxygen build up.
